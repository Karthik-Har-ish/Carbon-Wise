        header:"What is a carbon footprint?",
        text:"Carbon footprint is an index that measures the total greenhouse gas emissions that an individual, activity, product, company, or country emits into the atmosphere. It is useful for comparing greenhouse gas emissions and is typically expressed in tonnes of emissions (CO2-equivalent) per unit of comparison. Such units can include tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, per kilogram of protein consumed, per kilometer traveled, per piece of clothing, and so on. A product's carbon footprint includes emissions throughout its entire life cycle. These extend from production through the supply chain to final consumption and disposal."

        header:"Why do we need a carbon footprint calculator?",
        text:"Carbon (footprint) calculators are a type of eco-feedback technology that helps people understand how they affect the environment. Users can get an estimate of their overall carbon footprint—which includes both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions—by entering information about their lifestyle and living conditions. Carbon calculators have the potential to serve as a link between the pressing need to mitigate the worst effects of climate change and individual behavior and lifestyle choices."
